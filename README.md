# Health-Tracker

Project Idea for CCFL:

- Mental & Physical Health tracker
- 
- This is an application to be used for a user to track the mental & physical health of themselves and/or someone in their care. Example: Elderly, children, someone with special needs, etc... A user has the opportunity to track their day to day mental and physical health, as well as the variables and occurrences that may have attributed to their health.

- User stories:
- 
- - As an unregistered user, I would like to sign up with a email & password
- - As a registered user, I would like to sign in with an email and password
- - As a signed in user, I would like to change my password
- - As a signed in user, I would like to sign out
- - As a signed in user, I would like to create entries
-     - Entries are used to track the following:
-         - mental health / mood / physical pain
-             - what variables attributed to both?
-                 - what did the user do that day?
